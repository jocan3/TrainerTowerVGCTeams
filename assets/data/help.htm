<h1>About VGC Team Replays</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span
>This
tool allows you to look at trending teams used in Showdown based on public
battle replays. It also extracts information around moves, abilities and items
as well as links to battle replays for each team.</span></p>

<h2>Report data</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span
>Reports
are uploaded periodically and you can switch between datasets using the
dropdown menu at the top. Each dataset consists on a sample of battle replays
extracted from&nbsp;<a href="https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/"
target="_blank">Pokemon Showdown</a> and parsed to get the following
information into the report:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><i><span
>Usage:&nbsp;</span></i><span
>Number
of times a Pokemon team was used in a battle replay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><i><span
>Win</span></i><span
>:
Number of times a player using the Pokemon team won the battle in a replay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><i><span
>Users:</span></i><span
>&nbsp;Number
of different users that have played using the Pokemon team in the replays.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><i><span
>Win
ratio:&nbsp;</span></i><span>Ratio of number of wins respect to the number of times a
Pokemon team was used (x = win/usage).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><i><span
>Usage
ratio:</span></i><span>&nbsp;Ratio of the number of times a Pokemon team was
used respect to the total number of teams included in the report (x =
usage/total # of teams)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><i><span
>Relevance:</span></i><span
>&nbsp;Score
calculated based on the popularity of the Pokemon team (number of users) and
the win ratio. For instance, a team tested by a high number of users with a
high win ratio will have a high Relevance score.</span></p>

<h2>Interacting with the report</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span
>You
can play with the report of different ways when looking for strategies or team
building:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><i><span
>Search
by Pokemon:&nbsp;</span></i><span>If interested in one or more Pokemon, you can use the
search bar by typing the names (or part of the names) separated by spaces. For
instance, by typing: “Corvi Dracov” you would see teams that include
Corviknight and Dracovish.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><i><span
>Export
to CSV: </span></i><span>For those who want to use their own tools to play with
this data, there is an option to export the data into a CSV format. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><i><span
>Sorting:&nbsp;</span></i><span
>Each
column in the report is sortable by clicking on the column name.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><i><span
>Replays:&nbsp;</span></i><span
>By
clicking on this option, you will see links to the battle replays in Showdown
for the specific team. Battles are separated by wins and loses of that Pokemon
team.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><i><span
>Data*:</span></i><span
>&nbsp;This
data consists on moves, abilities and items per Pokemon extracted from the
battle replays where that team won the battle. Please note that this data is
parsed based on what you can actually see during the replay (that’s why EV
spreads or items/abilities that are not evident during the battle will not be
extracted). For each Pokemon stat, it will indicate the percentage and number
of times an specific move/item/ability was used out of the total. For instance,
the below information show that for Arcanine the move “Snarl” was used 5 times
out of the 15 times an Arcanine attacked in the winning replays.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span
>The
data also includes information of leads used in the battles.</span></p>

<h2>How to get the most of it</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span
>Players
new to VGC would have access to a huge number of teams and options to start
exploring. You can start by grabbing some of the most popular teams since those
are the ones that have already been tested by many users, and the report will
give you complete information around move sets, abilities, items and leads. You
will also have a big list of links to battle replays where you can see
strategies and how those teams are actually being used.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span
>Take
into consideration that creating a team based on this report only represents
the start of your competitive journey, as the best way to get better is to
practice a lot with the team by yourself and being able to identify
improvements and tweaks to counteract weaknesses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal ><span
>Experienced
players can also take advantage of the reports as they provide good insights of
how the meta is changing across the time. And you can also take some ideas that
could help you during your team building process as well as looking for
specific Pokemon usages.</span></p>
